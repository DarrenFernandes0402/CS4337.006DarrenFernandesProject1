Project 1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is my Project 1. The following are the instructions to run this racket code from the command prompt

  1) navigate to the directory using the cd command
    eg. if it was in my downloads directory, i would run cd \Users\<DarrenFernandes>\Downloads
  2) I would then run the following command to run the program
    racket Project1CodeDarrenFernandes.rkt
  3) If you want to run it in batch mode, you can run the following command:
    echo "+ 1 2" | racket Project1CodeDarrenFernandes.rkt -b
  4) You can also run it with files using the following command
    racket Project1CodeDarrenFernandes.rkt -b < input.txt

These are the basics for running the code. There are only three files in this folder. Here is what each does:
  1) Readme.md: A guide to using the code along with an overview of the files used in this project
  2) devlog.md: A look into the thought process while the code was being written. 
  3) Project1CodeDarrenFernandes.rkt: This is the actual program. It has 12 functions, and one call to the main function to call the code as soom as the program is run. It is by default in interactive mode meaning the user types all their commands in one after the other.
           It can also be run in batch mode, allowing you to pass in files with proper input to allow you to test the code. The code is also commented to explain necessary steps.
