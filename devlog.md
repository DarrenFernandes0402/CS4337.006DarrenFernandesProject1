I looked at the project and worked on it a bit so far. I know that subtraction is something I do not have to worry about to that is good. My initial thoughts were that there definitely have to be different functions for each part, since we need to handle multiple things. I think addition and multiplication can be the same function but division and a negative number have to be dealt with separately. So far I have made something to remove leading whitespaces based on what I think I will need. I might work on the main function next just to see what else I will need as I move through it.
I also added one more thing, the main loop. this is the loop taht first checks if it is in batch mode or regular mode. I also added the read method and the exit strategy. 
I added some mroe functionality to the main loop, I added the error handling method, a method to get the values from something that evaluates the necessary values, and something to check if there is anything remining in the expressions. I also then looped back to the main expression and added a fail case. The history keeps adding things to the start of history, which means when I add something to get it, I will reverse the list.

Today was much better, and I got as decent bit done for the code. I got to add the main functionality, the functions that do the evaluation of the functions. This mainly calls the functions that should do the necessary evaluations, but calls and handles them as needed.
