I looked at the project and worked on it a bit so far. I know that subtraction is something I do not have to worry about to that is good. My initial thoughts were that there definitely have to be different functions for each part, since we need to handle multiple things. I think addition and multiplication can be the same function but division and a negative number have to be dealt with separately. So far I have made something to remove leading whitespaces based on what I think I will need. I might work on the main function next just to see what else I will need as I move through it.
